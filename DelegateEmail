Thank you for purchasing a ticket to BSides Canberra 2019 – our biggest conference so far with over 2000 people registered to attend! 
We are looking forward to next week.

Registration will be open at the National Convention Centre at the following times:

Thursday 2pm – 6pm
Friday 8am – 5pm 
Saturday 8am – 1pm

You must have your eventbrite ticket with you to register. 
You do not need ID but each ticket can only be used once, so ensure you don’t share your ticket with anyone else. 
If you have purchased a student ticket, you will need to provide evidence of being a full-time student. 
It is also important to note that due to our liquor license arrangements, BSides Canberra is a 18+ event. 
Underage delegates can only attend if supervised by an adult.

Your delegate pack will include a booklet, lanyard, electronic badge, sticker and a free t-shirt voucher. 
You must wear both your lanyard and badge at all times (having just the lanyard or the badge will not be enough for entry).

Your t-shirt voucher can be used to redeem your free t-shirt at the merchandise desk located beside rego. 
Sizes will provided on a first-come basis. We will be also selling a limited number of BSides Canberra hooded jackets for $50, cash only.

BSides Canberra staff members will be identifiable throughout the conference by their maroon t-shirts with the yellow and red Cybernats logo. 
If you have any questions, issues or need help, please seek out a staff member for assistance. 
Please remember, BSides Canberra is wholly volunteer run, 
meaning everyone in a maroon t-shirt has given up their own time for free to make this awesome community event. 
Please treat all BSides Canberra staff with respect, follow their instructions, and abide by the Code of Conduct.

See you there!

Kylie & Silvio
